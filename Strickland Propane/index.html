                        have seen our products showcased during the annual "Grillstravaganza" sale as well as in state-wide propane 
                        conventions. With a total of 5 branches across the entire state of Texas, we are fully capable of supplying your
                        home with the primary fuel source for all your cooking, heating, and fueling needs.

                    <h2> Why us? </h2>
                    <p>
                        Here at Strickland, we not only provide you with the highest quality propane in the great state of Texas, but 
                        also with the warmth of our supportive and hardworking staff. Even under fierce competition from other suppliers
                        in the local area, we have held out through the years due to the leadership of our manager, Buck Strickand, and the 
                        unwavering loyalty we have to our customers. Should any of your propane orders go awry, or if you simply need
                        to refill your tank but don't want to do it yourself, you can always ask us to help by placing a work order.
